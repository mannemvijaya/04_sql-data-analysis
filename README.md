🧠 Task 4: SQL for Data Analysis
🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to leverage SQL as a powerful tool for analyzing structured e-commerce data.
Through writing optimized queries, this project demonstrates practical data analysis, trend discovery, and business insight generation.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
SQLite (executed via SQLiteOnline.com)

SQL (Structured Query Language)

Ecommerce Sample Dataset

📊 Project Highlights
This repository contains a hands-on SQL data analysis project built around a simulated e-commerce business. It includes:

Creation of normalized relational database schema

Realistic sample data for customers, products, and orders

Analytical SQL queries using JOINs, GROUP BY, subqueries, and views

PDF outputs to visualize query results

🧠 SQL Techniques Demonstrated
Efficient use of SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY

JOIN operations to combine multiple tables (INNER JOIN)

Aggregate functions like SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX

Subqueries for comparative and conditional analysis

Views for modular and reusable query structures

Basic query optimization using filtering and structure

🔍 Key Analytical Insights
The total number of orders placed and average product prices were derived using aggregate functions.

JOINs helped correlate customer information with the products they purchased.

Product sales summary identified which items were most in demand.

Subqueries were used to highlight premium products priced above average.

Views simplified repeated calculations and abstracted complexity for reuse.

🚀 Outcome
This project refined my SQL proficiency, deepened my understanding of data manipulation,
and demonstrated my ability to extract meaningful business insights from raw structured data — a critical skill for aspiring data analysts and engineers.
